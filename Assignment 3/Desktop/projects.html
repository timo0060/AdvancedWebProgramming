			<p class="bodyText">
				This was a website I made for the Sega Genesis in my Web Design class at Georgian College. It was my first real website that I've finished. I made
				it to showcase one of the most influencial gaming consoles of my youth. The Sega Genesis helped shape my gaming life and pushed me to want to develop games myself.
				I made sure to include a few of Sega's catch phrases of the era, as well as a small gallery for the console and the games I played.
				It was great to see the result of just 4 months of learning and I'm proud of the way it turned out, although many changes could be made to it now to 
				improve it's overal quality and appeal. <br><br>

			<p class="bodyText">
				The content manager was my first big website that had PHP functionality built into it as was as mySQL. It was a final project for my Intro into 
				Web Programming class, also at Georgian College. I am very happy with the way it turned out and the features that I have managed to include. These features
				include: Sign Up, Login, changing the logo, editing users, adding new users, and adding new web pages. That was the first time I've done any of that with PHP on such
				a large scale. As you can see, the design carried over to this website quite a bit, because I really enjoyed the way I managed to give it a visually appealing look.

			<a name="eggbert"><h1><u>EggBert</u></h1></a>
			<p class="bodyText">
				EggBert is an Wii remote controlled head that can pivot on the X axis and the Y axis. He has an Arduino as his heart and brain. I made EggBert
				for my Computer Architecture class at Georgian College. It was a basic final project that I think could have turned out better if I had a bigger arduino.
				The one I had was to small to have both the motor controll and a digital screen. I decided to just have the audio and use a cardboard cut out for the face.
				The problem there was that the Servo classes I was using interfered with the audio class I was using and neither the teacher or I could solve this problem.
				So EggBert became a happy mute egg. 
				<br><br>

			<a name="portfolio"><h1><u>Portfolio</u></h1></a>
			<p class="bodyText">
				The Porfolio is an assignment I did for my Advanced Web Programming class in Georgian College. It turned out great, and I tried a few new things that 
				I've never tried before and it helped bring the whole website together. I also think that it's my most visually appealing website to date and 
				I am very pleased with it. Although most of the design was taken from a previous assignment, <a href="#contentManager">here</a>, I feel that I improved
				it quite a bit and made it more unique and appealing. I believe that it is a job well done, but I'm sure there are some improvements that I can make to 
				it in the future as my skills and I develp into a more professional programmer.

			<a name="salesBonus"><h1><u>Sales Bonues Calculator</u></h1></a>
			<p class="bodyText">
				This was the first assignment in my Rapid Application development class at Georgian College. For it being the first assignment, and the first time I used C#
				I think it turned out great. This application allows the user to input their name, their employee number, how many hours they worked that month, and the total 
				monthly sales. The user can then click calculate to see how much of a sales bonus they've earned, clear everything, but the monthly sales, or send it to a print 
				preview. This application was also the first time I used the logo for Sun Lockdown. I like how it turned out, and I can't wait to add more projects like this to this list.
