			<h1><u>Early Life</u></h1>
			<p class="bodyText">
				My name is Timothy Mathew Radder, and I was born July 13th, 1994 in Newmarket, Ontario. From a young age I was always fascinated with computers
				and wanted to more with them. I would play many games on my old computers and "attempt" to upgrade them, but with my very basic , almost non-exsistent,
				knowledge back then, I would almost always have something go wrong. I learned from those mistakes however, and slowly gained more knowledge over the years.
			</p>
			<h1><u>Early Education</u></h1>
			<p class="bodyText">
				I attended Baxter Central Public School from Kindergarten to Grade 8. From there I went on to attend Bear Creek Secondary School, which helped further my knowledge
				in computers and set in motion my desire to become a Computer programmer. In Grade 11 I took a computer programming class, where I learned basic java and basic JApplets
				and I exceeded in that class. I took the Grade 12 Computer Programmer class and developed my java skills even more. Along with these two computer programming classes,
				I took three Computer Engineering classes. One in Grade 10, one in Grade 11, and one in Grade 12. I finished the Grade 12 class with the highest mark in my class at a 97% overall.
				Throughout my Highschool studies, I managed to obtain honour role all four years and graduate with one of the highest averages.				 
			</p>
			<h1><u>Current Education</u></h1>
			<p class="bodyText">
				I am currently attending Georgian College for Computer Programmer Analyst. My Highschool education prepared me quite well for College and has made
				grasping the concepts and knowledge a lot easier for me. I'm very excited to put my new found knowledge into practice with a hopeful great, and successful Co-Op
				this winter. 	 
			</p>
			<h1><u>Work Experience</u></h1>
			<p class="bodyText">
				I haven't had a job in the IT industry as a professional, but I am often asked by friends and family to help them solve their computer problems. 
				My first job was cleaning up various plaza's throughout Barrie Ontario with two of my brothers and my father, getting paid next to nothing. As I was just in highschool t the time and having
				no need to spend money, it was ok. That lasted for about a year and a half until we couldn't take it any longer. After that, I got a job for a week as a door to 
				door salesperson selling satellite internet. I quickly found something else though, because I didn't believe in the product. I worked for a month and a half at a concrete construction company
				as a temp before finding my current job as a Tim Hortons employee.
